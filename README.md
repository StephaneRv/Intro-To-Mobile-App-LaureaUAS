### Intro-To-Mobile-App-LaureaUAS ###

Creation of a simple mobile app using React-Native and Ionic frameworks for the second module of the Mobile App Design course from Laurea University Of Applied Sciences.

Note:

  -If you want to try the app by cloning the repository, the weather feature won't work as the RapidAPI API key has not been pushed.


  -If you want to try the register/login system you'll have to set up the mySQL database, the script to create the tables is in the database folder.
